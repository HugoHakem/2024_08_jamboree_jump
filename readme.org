#+TITLE: Jamboree

* Overall goal
Generate analyses/components that contribute to JUMP production
* Specific tasks
- [ ] Generate a general report of JUMP metadata:
  - [ ] How many different MoAs are available?
  - [ ] What is the distribution of plates per source?
- [ ] Develop a metric+method to quantify the biases for any pair of samples
- [ ] Write a set of examples on how to do different things:
  - [ ] Fetch one or multiple images
  - [ ] How to plot plates to find plate effects
  - [ ] How do we get a quick and informative overview of the data?
- [ ] MoAs (ChemoInformatics)
  - [ ] What compounds pathways do we cover?
  - [ ] Do morphological profiles match compounds with similar activity?
  - [ ] How well do MoAs cluster compared to others? (Can this be answered through MAP?)
